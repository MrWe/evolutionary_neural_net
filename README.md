# evolutionary_neural_net

This will be a test where i'll use an evolutionary algorithm to train a neural net. 

# Simulation details

This program will simulate populations of hunters and gatherers. The gatherers will try to collect resources and the hunters will
spawn randomly and try to kill the gatheres. 

Both populations will learn to get better at their jobs. The purpose is to see which behaviors that emerge.
